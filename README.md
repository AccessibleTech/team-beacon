# Team Beacon

## The Problem

New environments pose a challenge to anyone. But for those with visual impairments the issue is amplified, often requiring them to rely on those around them until they learn the layouts.

Additionally, environments are changing all the time, often offering visual only cues.

## Our Solution

For those with visual impairments, we wanted to offer freedom in a safe place.

iBeacons are used to broadcast new layouts, rooms, objects and even hazards to those with the app installed. Using close proximity, the beacons can alert you when you are within certain distances of where you need to go, what is close to you and any obstacles along the way.
